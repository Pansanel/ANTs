//' @title Eigenvector centrality
//' @description compute the eigenvecto centrality for each vertices through Armadillo c++ library.
//' @param m a matrix.
//' @return A numeric vector corresponding to the Eigenvector centrality of each nodes.
//' @details EigenvectorCpp centrality is the first non-negative met.eigenvector value obtained through the linear transformation of an adjacency matrix. This centrality measure quantifies not only a node connectedness, but also the connections of the nodes to whom it is connected. Thus, a node can have a high met.evcent value by having a high met.degree or met.strength, or by being connected to nodes that have high degrees or strengths.
